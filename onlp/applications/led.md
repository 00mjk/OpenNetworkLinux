# LEDs

## LED Information Structure

The current status of an LED is queried using ```onlp_led_info_get``` to populate the ```onlp_led_info_t``` structure.

LED features include things like available colors, blinking modes, and character display features.

## LED Specific APIs

You can change the current mode of the LED if supported.
